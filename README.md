# Technical Report: Building a CRUD API with Ruby on Rails and Stimulus

![](./)

## Introduction:
This technical report outlines the development of a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) API project using Ruby on Rails for the backend and Stimulus for the frontend. The project aims to provide a seamless user experience for managing student records.

## Project Setup:
- Ruby on Rails was chosen for the backend due to its robustness, convention over configuration, and active community support.
- Stimulus, a JavaScript framework, was selected for the frontend to enhance interactivity and responsiveness without introducing unnecessary complexity.

## Backend Implementation:

### Model:
- The Student model represents student records in the database.
- Validation rules ensure that attributes like name, phone, email and registration are present for each student record.

### Controller:
- The StudentsController handles CRUD operations for student records.
- RESTful routes are defined to handle listing, creating, updating, and deleting student records.
- Strong parameters sanitize and permit specific attributes from the frontend.

### Database Migration:
- Migrations define the database schema, including columns for student attributes and timestamps.
- Subsequent migrations modify the schema to reflect changes in the model.

## Frontend Implementation:

### Stimulus Controllers:
- Stimulus controllers enhance user interaction with frontend components.
- Controllers render student records, handle form submissions, and manage CRUD actions.

### HTML Views:
- HTML views use Stimulus data attributes to bind JavaScript behavior to HTML elements.
- Forms are updated to reflect attribute name changes, such as firstName and lastName.

## Challenges and Solutions:
- Attribute Naming: Updating attribute names from Portuguese to English required changes in both the model and the frontend.
- Database Migration: Modifying the database schema necessitated careful planning to ensure data integrity.
- Error Handling: Proper error handling provides informative messages to users in case of validation failures or server errors.

## Conclusion:
- The project successfully implements a CRUD API using Ruby on Rails and Stimulus, offering a seamless user experience for managing student records.
- RESTful conventions, strong parameters, and Stimulus data binding ensure a maintainable and scalable architecture.
- Future enhancements could include authentication, pagination, and frontend performance optimization.

This technical report provides an overview of the development process and key considerations for building a CRUD API project with Ruby on Rails and Stimulus, highlighting technical aspects and best practices implemented throughout the project lifecycle.
